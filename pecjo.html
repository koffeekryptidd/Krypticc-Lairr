          This is a TTRPG system I developed over several years of testing with various friendgroups. I made it as a one-off "mod" to D&D Fifth Edition,
          but it ended up developing into it's own thing over time. This inspired me to do more work with TTRPG stuff as well since I had a lot of fun
          making it. I will include a link to a google drive folder that includes all of the editions of this TTRPG, including the very first edition that
          was literally just some text on my phone's notepad. I hope you enjoy :]
        </p>
        <p class="translucent-box indented">
          I am planning on working on a fifth edition the next time I have free time, because after working on my other TTRPG that I made from scratch I did
          notice some flaws that I would like to iron out. In the beginning, Peculiar Journeys was a D&D 5e mod more than it's own system, and that definitely
          shows. I would like to completely rewrite it to fix some of those growing pains it visibly has.
